# React Flow Showcase

這個 Side Project 主要是為了展示我對 React 和 TypeScript 的熟練度。使用了 @xyflow/react 12.0.0-next.24 的 beta 版本，並利用其提供的新 types 和 hooks，展現我對新工具的掌握能力。

This side project showcases how I familiarize myself with React and TypeScript, utilizing the 12 beta version of @xyflow/react 12.0.0-next.24 with its new types and hooks to demonstrate my capability with new tools.

### Project Highlights

- Problem-Solving Expertise
  Throughout the development of this project, I frequently referred to GitHub issues and discussions, Discord channels, and official documentation. Given the beta version's lack of official documentation, I also navigated through the source code to understand and implement new features. This involved:

- Identifying Solutions: Efficiently navigating through GitHub issues, Discord channels, official docs, and source code to find solutions to common and uncommon problems.
- Community Engagement: Participating in discussions on GitHub and Discord to gain insights and contribute to problem-solving.
- Staying Updated: Keeping up with the latest updates and best practices shared within the GitHub community, Discord developer groups, and official documentation.

### Frontend Development Skills

As a frontend developer, this project allowed me to:

- Showcase Technical Proficiency: Implement complex features using React and TypeScript with a strong understanding of component-based architecture.
- Leverage Advanced Tools: Utilize advanced tools and libraries such as React Flow for dynamic, interactive UI elements.
- Optimize Performance: Focus on performance optimization and best practices to ensure smooth and efficient user experiences.

### Key Features

- React Flow Integration: Implemented a sophisticated flowchart with dynamic node connections, showcasing advanced usage of React Flow.
- TypeScript Mastery: Demonstrated deep understanding of TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.
- Modern UI/UX: Developed a modern, user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

### Why This Project Stands Out

- Innovation: Leveraged the latest beta tools and libraries, reflecting my proactive approach to adopting new technologies.
- Problem-Solving: Highlighted my ability to effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by actively engaging with the developer community on GitHub and Discord, consulting official documentation, and navigating source code.
- Technical Depth: Showcased my in-depth knowledge and application of React and TypeScript in a real-world scenario.
